        <p>Arguably one of the most important updates to the web as we know it was the introduction of Responsive Design. In the late 2000s, the release of smartphones caused a surge in need for websites scaled to fit screen sizes that were smaller than your average monitor. Responsive Design is exactly that. It is the approach used in development to make the medium(website) respond to the userâ€™s interactions regardless of the screen size or platform. Good web design is responsive and will work well no matter what platform the user is interacting with. Responsive Design is critical to the success of web technologies. If the website is visiting is unusable in a mobile format, that person will most likely choose to leave that site. <br>
            <br>
            The introduction of CSS Grids and Flexbox dramatically changed the landscape for Responsive Design in web technologies. For this project, I decided to use Flexbox as I was already somewhat familiar with it. Flexbox gives developers the ability to alter the way your website looks depending on the screen size. Not only this, but Flexbox also updates in real-time and can be seen by adjusting the size of your browser window. Flexbox is just one example of a medium used in Responsive Web Development. <br>

            This assignment gave me hands-on experience in building a responsive web site. I learned web technologies such as CSS Flexbox, and GitHub to piece together my final site.
